Programming Assignment 5.2: Pairwise Swap

Given a singly linked list, write a program to swap the elements of the linked list pairwise. For example, if the linked list is 1->2->3->4->5 then the program
should change it to 2->1->4->3->5.

You need to implement ONLY the following functions, the main() function is already provided with the code, so do not implement the main() function.


push(struct Node** head_ref, int new_data)
// This function takes the address of the pointer to the head of the linked list and an integer as arguments.
// This function creates a new node with data as "new_data" and appends this node to the front of the original linked list.

Working Example:

push(&start, 5)
Linked List: 5
head pointed to: 5

push(&start, 6)
Linked List: 6->5
Head Pointed to: 6

push(&start, 1)
Linked List: 1->6->5
Head Pointed to: 1


pairWiseSwap(struct Node *head);
// This function takes the address of the head node as an argument.
// Inside this function, you need to implement the pairwise swapping.

printList(struct Node *node)
// This function takes the address of the head node as argument and prints the elements of the linked list in a single line separated by space.

The structure of the node of linked list has already been defined as the following, hence do not define it in your code:

struct Node
{    int data;
    struct Node *next;
};


Input:
The first line of input contains an integer N, denoting the number of elements in linked list
The second line contains the N elements in a single line separated by space

Output:
Output the manipulated linked list elements in a single line separated by space.

Example:
Input:
5
5 4 3 2 1

Output:
2 1 4 3 5
