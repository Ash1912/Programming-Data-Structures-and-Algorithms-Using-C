Programming Assignment 5.1: Reverse a linked list

Write a program in C to reverse a linked list.

You are supposed to implement only these following three functions:

push(struct Node** head_ref, int new_data);
// This function takes two arguments, first is the address of the pointer to the head
of the linked list and second is the data which has to be inserted
// The function should create a new node with data as new_data and
appends this new node in the front of the original linked list.

Working Example:
push(&head, 2);
Linked List: 2

push(&head, 3);
Linked List: 3->2

push(&head, 4)
Linked List: 4->3->2

reverse(struct Node** head_ref);
//This function takes the address of the pointer to the head node of the linked list as the
argument.
//This function reverse the linked list

printList(struct Node *head);
// This function takes the address of the head node of the linked list and prints the N elements of the list in a single line separated by space.

Input:
The first line of input contains an integer N denoting the number of elements.
The second line contains the N integers in a single line separated by space.

Output:
Output the reverse of linked list in single line separated by space

Example:
Input:
5
5 4 3 2 1

Output:
5 4 3 2 1
