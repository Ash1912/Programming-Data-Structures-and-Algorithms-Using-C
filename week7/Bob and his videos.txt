Programming Assignment 7.4: Bob and his videos

Bob recently got a collection of ‘A’ really funny videos. He has a software which helps him make different playlists of C videos out of all the videos. Every time he uses the software, he gets a new playlist everytime. He found out the algorithm used by the software for this.

Each video should be played
Between the two videos, there should be at least ‘B’ different videos.
Write a program in C++ to help Bob find the number of possible playlists. Since the number of playlists may be too large, find No. of playlists % 100003.


Input:

There is a single line having A B C
Where A – the total number of videos available
B – the minimum of different videos which have to be played before a video can be repeated
C – The number of videos that has to be there in the playlist.
Output:

A single line containing the total number of possible playlists % 100003.


Constraints:

1 <= A <= 100
0 <= B <= 100
A <= C <= 100

Example:
Input:
2 1 3

Output:
2

Explanation:
The total number of videos are 2, let's say v1 and v2. The size of playlist should be 3.
A video can be repeated only if, in between, there is 1 different video.
There are only two possible playlists possible
{v1, v2, v1}
{v2, v1, v2}
