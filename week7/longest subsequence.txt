Programming Assignment 7.3: Longest Increasing Subsequesnce

The Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) is defined as the longest subsequence of a sequence such that all elements of the subsequence are sorted in increasing order.
Write a program in C to find the Longest Increasing Subsequence of a given array A.

Input:
The first line of input contains an integer N, denoting the size of array A.

Output:
Length of longest common subsequence.

Example:
Input:
5
3 10 2 1 20

Output:
3


Explanation:
The longest increasing subsequence is 3, 10, 20.

Constraints:
1 <= N <= 105
-1000 <= Ai <= 1000
