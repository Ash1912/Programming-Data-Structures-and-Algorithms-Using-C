Programming Assignment 3.1 : Jumping Numbers

One day Ajit got a strange feeling of jumping from one point to another on a number line (containing positive integers). The jumping from one point to another can only be done in one dimension.
He will start from point 0 from which he will do a lot of jumps. He can only jump in a specific sequence:

1-jump, 2-jump, 3-jump, 1jump, 2-jump, 3-jump, 1-jump, and so on.
(1->2->3->1->2->3->1...)

1-jump means that if Ajit is at point x on the number line, he will jump to the point x+1.
2-jump means that id Ajit is at point x on the number line, he will jump to the point x+2.

3-jump means that id Ajit is at point x on the number line, he will jump to the point x+3.



Write a program in C which given the input point a outputs whether Ajit can reach this point a after some number of jumps or not.

Input: The first line contains a single integer a denoting the point Ajit asks about.

Output: Output "YES" without a quotes if Ajit can arrive at point a or "NO" without a quotes 
otherwise.

Example1:
Input: 3
Output: YES
He can take jump sequence (1Â­>2) to reach point 3.


Input: 2
Output: NO
From 0 he can take 1 jump to reach point 1 but after that he can take only 2 jumps which will lead him to point 3.
Jump sequence (1Â­>2).


Constraints:  0<=a<=1018
