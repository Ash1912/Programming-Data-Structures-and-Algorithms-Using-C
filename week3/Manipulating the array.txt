Given an array X of N numbers and an integer K, during a turn maximum value of array Xi is chosen as MAX. Then Xi = MAX-Xi is done for every 1<=i<=N.
Write a program in C to find the array after K turns.

Input:
The first line of input contains the number N and K respectively. N is the number of elements in the array and K is the number of turns.

Output:
Output N numbers in a single line after K turns. It should be the elements of array X after K turns

Example:

Input:
4 1
5 -1 7 0

Output:
2 8 0 7

Constraints:
1<=N<=105
0<=K<=109

Xi <= 109
