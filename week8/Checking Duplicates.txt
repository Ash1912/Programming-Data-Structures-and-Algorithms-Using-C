PA 8.1 - Checking Duplicates

Given an array A of N integers, and a number k which is smaller than the size of the array. Write a program in C++ which returns true if the array contains duplicates within k distance.

Input:
The first line contains the integers N and k separated by space.
The second line contains the N integers separated by space

Output:
Output "Yes" if it contains duplicates within distance k else output "No".

Constraints:
1 <= N <= 105
-1000 <= Ai <= 1000

Example:
Input:
6 3
1 2 3 1 4 5

Output:
Yes

Explanation:
1 is repeated at distance 3.
