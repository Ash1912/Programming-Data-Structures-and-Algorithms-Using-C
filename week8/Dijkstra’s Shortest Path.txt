PA 8.3 - Dijkstraâ€™s Shortest Path

Given an undirected/ directed weighted graph G, find the shortest distance from the source vertex to all the vertices in the graph. Weights of all the edges in the graph are positive. 


Input: 
The first line of input contains integers N and s separated by space, denoting the number of vertices in G and the source vertex respectively.
The second line contains the adjacency matrix A of graph G, with the value at A[i,j] is the weight of the edge joining vertex i and vertex j. 


Output: 

Output result in N lines, where each line contains the vertex number and its distance from the source separated by space 

In case of directed graph, if there is no path from source to any of the vertex then dist value should be 1000.( indicating no path.)


The function shortestDist  need to be coded :

int* shortestDist(int** graph, int src, int no_of_vertices).

This function stores distance in array dist[no_of_vertices]  and returns this array.


Example: 

Input:

3 0 

0 4 0

4 0 1

0 1 0

Output:

0 0

1 4

2 5
