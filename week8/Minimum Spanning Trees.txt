PA 8.4 - Minimum Spanning Tree (Prims)

Given a connected graph G, find the minimum spanning tree of a graph. 
Write a program in C++ for Prim's Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) algorithm.


Input: Number of vertices in G and Adjacency matrix A of graph G, with the value at A[i,j] is the weight of the edge joining vertex i and vertex j. 


Output:  Edge (vertex i -- vertex  j ) and weight of the edge in the below format: 

i -- j  w


Note: The vertex are numbered from 0 to n-1, where n is the total number of vertices.



Example: 

Input:

5

0 2 0 6 0

2 0 3 8 5

0 3 0 0 7

6 8 0 0 9

0 5 7 9 0

Output:

0 -- 1 2

1 -- 2 3

0 -- 3 6

1 -- 4 5



The following function should store MST in array.  Assuming the vertex 0 as source.

int* prim(int** graph,int no_of_vertices); 

This function should return an array of length V arr[i] stores the parent of ith vertex. For source vertex arr[0] = -1
