Given an input string S, write a program in C++ to find the maximum occurring character in S. For example, if the input string is "tushita" then the program should return t.

Input:
The first line contains an integer representing the size of S
The second line contains the string S

Output:
Maximum occurring character. If more than one character has maximum count then return the first character with the maximum count in the input string. 

Example:
Input:

Output:
