Programming Assignment 6.2 : Heap Sort using Min-Heap

One of the main application of Heaps is Heap-Sort.  It consists of 2 steps 

(1) Build the heap and 

(2) Sorted array is created by repeatedly removing the largest element (Heap is updated after each removal to maintain the heap). 


Input

	N

	x1 x2 ……… xn

where,

 N is the total numbers to be sorted

 xi    input numbers


Output

y1 y2 ……… yn    

where array y is sorted


Heap sort function is already made available to you 

You need to complete the build heap and heapify function 



You need to code the following functions



// function creates and build a heap using minHeapify

void createHeap(struct MinHeap* minHeap){

// Single Node is a heap   

    			// Start from bottom most and rightmost internal node and heapify all internal nodes in bottom up way

 

	}

  

// heapify a min Heap.

void heapify(struct MinHeap* minHeap, int idx){

// idx is the index of the node you want to heapify

}
