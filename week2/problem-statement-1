Programming Assignment 2.1 : Print Lower Triangle of a Matrix

Write a program in C that reads an MxN matrix A and prints the lower triangular matrix.


Example

1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9


Output of the above matrix: 
1 0 0 
4 5 0 
7 8 9


INPUT:

First line contains two integers M and N separated by whitespace. The next M lines contain elements of matrix A, starting with the topmost row. Within each row, the elements are given from left to right.

OUTPUT:

Print the lower triangular matrix

CONSTRAINTS:

1 <= M <= 5, 1 <= N <= 5.

Elements in the matrix will be in the range [-100,100]
