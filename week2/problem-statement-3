Programming Assignment 2.3 : Lexicographically smallest palindrome

Given a string S having characters from English alphabets ['a' - 'z'] and '.' as the special character.  Write a program in C to construct the lexicographically smallest palindrome by filling each of the faded character ('.') with a lower case alphabet.

Definition:
The smallest lexicographical order is an order relation where string s is smaller than t, given the first character of s (s1) is smaller than the first character of t (t1), or in case they are equivalent, the second character, etc. For example "aaabbb" is smaller than "aaac" because although the first three characters are equal, the fourth character b is smaller than the fourth character c.

Input:
String S

Output:
Print lexicographically smallest palindrome after filling each '.' character, ­if it possible to construct one. Print  -­1 otherwise.

Example 1:

Input: a.b.a
Output: aabaa

Example 2:
 
Input: cb.bc
Output: cbabc

Example 3:

Input: a.b
Output: -1  





Input Constraints:

	String S can be of size 100
